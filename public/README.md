Citation: To help store and parse images we used Axios 
https://github.com/axios/axios?fbclid=IwAR3WQw2hhFXdq-7J0nY2EjeBR6ZfzO3eljxXHpzp6sFyOfnqwT80-dzBOkM
Used cloudinary to store images to the server 
https://cloudinary.com/documentation

Notes: We've implemented a simple CRUD wishlist wherein a user can
login and view their wishlist. Along with this, they can Add items, Edit items
and Delete items in the wishlist. The user who is logged in has their name displayed
at the top, and they then have the option of logging out. While all our functionality 
for SignUp is present, due to CORS issues we were unable to get it to function, 
but sincerely hope that it works for you. We've used AJAX and HTTP to implement
all our calls to the server and have tested it against Postman (REALLY HELPFUL)

Test Account:
Username: login
Password: login

Extra Credit:
● A flashier interface (5%)
● A mobile interface (5%)
(We hope you enjoy our implementation :))
