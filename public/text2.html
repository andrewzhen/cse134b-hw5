		<p id="halloween"><dfn>Halloween</dfn> is the eve of All Saint's Day where it is celebrated by children who dress in costume and solicit candy or other treats door-to-door and takes place on the night of <time datetime="10-31">October 31</time>. <cite>Google</cite></p>

		<p>According to legend, every Halloween, a strange and grotesque old lady roams the streets, preying on children who are trick-or-treating alone. Some call her <em>"The Leg Woman"</em> and others refer to her as <em>“The Legmonger”</em>.</p>

		<p>One boy was on his own when he heard a rustling in the bushes next to him. An old woman with stringy, black hair and a hideous, wrinkled face emerged from the undergrowth. The boy was startled to see she was holding <strong>a severed leg</strong> in her hands and waving it in his face.</p>

		<p><q>Do you want a leg?</q>, she cried. <q>Do you want a <strong>LEEEEG</strong>?</q></p>

	<small><s>I made this story up all by myself.</s> This story was not authored by me, a student at <abbr title="University of California, San Diego">UCSD</abbr>, but was found online at <cite><a href="https://www.scaryforkids.com/m">scaryforkids.com</a></cite>.</small>

	<p>Following this story, a user name <bdi>timelorddocterdaughter</bdi> commented: "What if I repeated her question back to her?"</p>

	<p>In the spirit of Halloween, the Chinese and Japanese character for <span id="dracula">"Dracula"</span> is: 
		<data value="20934">
			<ruby>
				<rb><u>德古拉</u></rb>
				<rp> (</rp>
				<rt>ドラキュラ</rt>
				<rp>)</rp>

	<p>To print out the word "Halloween" 10 times in Python, you can write:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(1, 11):
	print(str(i) + " Halloween")</code><p>Output:</p><samp>1 Halloween
2 Halloween
3 Halloween
4 Halloween
5 Halloween
6 Halloween
7 Halloween
8 Halloween
9 Halloween
10 Halloween
	</samp>
	</pre>

	<p>I had originally written this erroneous code that outputed only <span id="halloween-word">"Halloweens"</span> number 0-9, which can be confusing:</p>
	<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(<mark>10</mark>):
	print(str(i) + " Halloween")</code><p>Output:</p><samp>0 Halloween
1 Halloween
2 Halloween
3 Halloween
4 Halloween
5 Halloween
6 Halloween
7 Halloween
8 Halloween
9 Halloween</samp></pre>

	<p>Where the variable <var>i</var> represents the number of times the word has printed out.</p>

	<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Did you know? If you say <kbd>Happy Halloween</kbd> to a smart device, they will say it back.</p>

	<p>Make sure to drink enough H<sub>2</sub>O and not any NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> when you go <i>trick-or-treating</i>!</p>

	<p>Legend has it that if you spell "Halloween" backwards during the last minute of October 31 as <bdo dir="rtl">Halloween</bdo>, then the night will last <span class="big-font">forever</span>.</p>
